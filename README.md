# Optimized Dumpster Siting Based on Demand

## Background

This project was inspired by a previous project completed by my team in the class 1.101, Introduction to Civil and Environmental Engineering Design. That project looked at creatign a prototype autonomous dumpster that would convievably replace garbage trucks and gousehold track carts in the city of Cambridge's garbage collection system. The original premise of this project was to look at where those autonomous dumpsters would be placed in teh city to optimally meet community needs, and where garbage accumulation sites could be placed. Currently, we have yet to consde the dynamic element of the autonomous dumpsters; we are only considering static distributions of dumpsters of varying capacities and optimizing for the best static arrangement. Further work would include adding complexity to the optimization and adding reatures such as:
- Dumpster routing
- Garbage accumulation sites ("mother dumpsters")
